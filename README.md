# human-activity-recognition

Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is popular research area in computer vision and human-computer interaction. HAR aims to successfully classify different human activities based on a series of observations obtained from sensors that are affected by human movement. 

Experiments were carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years while wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy) on the waist. Each person performed six activities: Walking, Walking upstairs, Walking downstairs, Sitting, Standing and Laying. The data collected consists of **561 different features** generated from raw accelerometer and gyroscope sensor signals found in smartphones.

# Project Objective
Using the readings from the sersons, I first built and compared the performance of different classification models used to predict the activites performed by the volunteers. Next, due to the large number of features, I implemented a feature selection process to eliminate redudant and irrelevant features while still maintaining high predictive performance.
